# AnomalyDetection

Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data
This project aims to detect anomalies in time series data using machine learning techniques.

Overview
Anomalies, also known as outliers, are data points that differ significantly from the majority of the data. Detecting anomalies in time series data is crucial for various applications such as fraud detection, network security, and predictive maintenance.

In this project, we use a combination of statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to identify anomalies in time series data.

Features
Data preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
Statistical methods: Z-score, moving average, and exponential smoothing.
Machine learning algorithms: Isolation Forest, Autoencoder, LSTM.
Installation
To install the required dependencies, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare your time series dataset in CSV format.
Run the Jupyter notebook anomaly_detection.ipynb.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data and apply anomaly detection techniques.
Analyze the results and visualize the detected anomalies.
